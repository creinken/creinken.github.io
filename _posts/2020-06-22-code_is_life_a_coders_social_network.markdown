    Going into this project started out very stressful. Life kept throwing me curve ball after curve ball to the point where I didn't get to start on it until mid-day Thursday instead of Monday. Behind as I was made it difficult to stay calm especially whenever I would get stuck on major problems of which there were a fair few. Each time that happened the only thing I could think was that I wasn't going to get it done in time.
		The stress situations aside I did my best to make a functioning simple coder's social network where programmers could log in with a local account or their Github account. I still have many plans for this project, but the current functionality works to my satisfaction. There is one model that might be a little confusing as to why I added it instead of just using users directly. It's mostly for future plans but also to satisfy one of the project requirements. I created a commenter model with a one to one relationship to users. Users don't have comments directly however commenters do.
		The main function currently is users can share their coding projects on the site and other users can "comment" or make suggestions/help with potential issues that the user is having. One feature however that could have had a bit more work put into it had I had more time but life said nope was the scope requirement. I only created a very simple scope that selected all the projects of the user whose project page you were viewing where the language was Ruby.
		I know I could have done way more if life hadn't gotten in the way, but all in all I'm satisfied with what I created. Stress asside I also enjoyed myself while working on it.
