I came to the realization that I wanted to write software at a young age. I was so enamered with being able to make own programs to get the computer to do things I wanted it to do that I just started feeding myself everything I could get my hands on when it came to programming. I sifted through books on programming, then the internet happened and I was able to start finding web sites dedicated to programming. Eventually college happened, but at this point I had aquired so much on the major programming languages that what I was being taught in school I already knew. This got discouraging and I ended up dropping out because I wasn't learning anything. Over time I fell behind on my knowledge but was still learning what I could where I could. It's come to a point where my desire to do what I love has come to out weigh any cost to make it my career since I haven't been able to make it my career being self taught.
