This was by far my favorite project of all. React and Redux are so versitile for making a front end. I did run into a few problems because I was out of practice with rails so communicating with the Api caused some hiccups. However I'm very satisfied with how it turned out.

The biggest challenge I ran into was actually not the direct communication with the back end. It was however related to that. Controlling the information storage and access on the Redux front end was my biggest challenge mostly with the nested routes. From my understanding most of the time "page" container components are usually set up as functional components in React however I had to keep nesting what normally would have been functional components as child classes of the React Component class so I could have access to the component lifecycle methods. Mostly componentDidMount as I kept needing to update my store data with data from the api as I would go down the nesting hole.

Challenges aside I found this project to be potentially my favorite one and can't wait to do more things with React and Redux.
